<h1>Basics of Web Development Internship:</h1>
	<p>In August-September of 2021, during my early year at university, I completed a web development basics internship at Immesense Interactive Solutions. Throughout the internship, I gained a very good understanding of HTML and CSS3, and also began to learn server-side languages like PHP and MySQL.</p>
